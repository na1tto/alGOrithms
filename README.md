As I do a stepback from web development in Go let's take a look in some algorithms implemented in this language, this repo is a way for me to strengthen my knowledge in the syntax and programming logic used in this language!

**Why is algorithms important?**

For me personally algorithms is a very good way to translate ideas I have in my head into code, this skill trait is very important when you are working in a field that requires solutions for daily problems (or problems in general), so studying algorithms makes me exercise this habit of thinking in a problem and translating it into code that works and can help other people trying to solve similar problems.

**Why in Go?**

I normally try to study algorithms in C++ or C because of code marathons but since I started to study web development in Go i'm gonna use this programming area to make me understand and write better go code in general, I know it's not the best practice for a web centred language but I'm doing it because why not? :p

(for now im using some examples and tests from the Algorithms with Go course, here's their repo -> [algorithmswithgo.com](https://github.com/joncalhoun/algorithmswithgo.com.git))
